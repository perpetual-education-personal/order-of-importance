# ROAD MAP : What you need to know

In order of importance. _Please_ help us make this the best list it can be. Maybe we'll make it a JSON thing later - or somehow use it for the PHP or JS lessons later, but for now: Markdown.

The big-picture [success checklist](https://perpetual.education/resources/success-checklist/) already exists. That includes things like your attitude etc., - but here is a more concrete list of things that you can do to PROVE your abilities to yourself.

There's this other Quora answer Derek wrote - that also has the order of things [here](https://perpetual.education/in-what-order-should-i-learn-design-and-development-for-the-web/)

There's also Study Hall: which - has a lot of these prompts already. If we go over it with you, will you be able to answer the questions? Have you done any of the prompts there?

We expect most of these to point to the projects that are already in the DFTW curriculum but that we can also suggest more projects too.

These things are the things you need to know. When you're learning so many things - it can be tricky to stay centered. So, here's a list. We're going to try our best to give you ways to prove your understanding of these - but if we don't: It's your job to make sure you feel confident with this. Figure out a way to prove it to _yourself_. That's when you'll _really_ **know** you know it. If all else fails, practice. And ask for help to see things from a different prospective that might click.

If you are taking a hard-line towards UX or programming specifically, then some of these might not apply to you after their introductions.


## **GOALS**

- Collect a concise list of concepts and associated projects to act as a road map

- Students can fork the repo and use it as an optional resume piece

- This might be a bit long-winded as we (derek in this case) writes it - but hopefully we can then edit it down and keep it clear and simple

---


## ⬤ Basics

### The general names and scopes of the various computer equipment and software you are using

This might seem simple, but the reason it is so important is because the mental models for this will be foundational as you move forward. Can you explain how a basic computer works, what inputs and outputs there are, how those control the software, and how the system sends and receives messages? As with most things on this list: you just need to know enough to discuss the subject and be effective.

Related lessons: [what-is-a-computer](https://perpetual.education/lesson/what-is-a-computer/)

- [ ] Done [link to quiz](https://peprojects.dev) (This should probably be one of the practice interview questions)


### How to maintain your file structure and organize your work station

This is something you'll always be maintaining and building on. If your files and your workflow is a mess, people will notice - and they'll take you less seriously. You'll take longer to do things - and it's just very telling when someone is too stubborn to adapt and try new things. This includes how your directory structures are setup, iCloud, Drive, spaces, and also how you use keyboard short-cuts. It might seem like _personal preference_ - and it is. If you are choosing to be a mess, then - we'll know that your personal preference is to be slow an inefficient for no good reason.

Related lessons: [the-file-system](https://perpetual.education/lesson/the-file-system/) and [file-types-images-docs-and-html](https://perpetual.education/lesson/file-types-images-docs-and-html/)

- [ ] Done (not sure how to check this yet) (maybe we make a follow along video)


## ⬤ Mindset

### Something about data structures in daily life

Detailed outlines/drawings. [human-data-collection](https://perpetual.education/lesson/human-data-collection/) and [human-memory](https://perpetual.education/lesson/human-memory/) lessons could spark some ideas.

- [ ] Done

### Write about your learning journey and process

We think you should be writing about your process and learning experience. We can't make you do it, but we know that if you do - you'll learn more, make better work, understand the process more - and make a lot more money. You can always go back and edit your posts later.

- [ ] Happening [link to proof](https://peprojects.dev)


## ⬤ HTML and CSS

We learn a bunch of stuff later in the course about HTML / so, we'll note that further down. But if you are revisiting these projects later - then you should totally incorporate those ideas here.

### How to traverse the file structure with the OS, the command line, and have a clear understanding of file paths and how to link HTML documents and images etc.

This might seem _basic_ but we see students (and even senior devs) just guessing and trying `../` or `./` until it works and moving on. This is not reasonable. If the web it a complex system of linked resources, then you absolutely have to have a solid handle on how to link things together and how file paths work and how to write them. And it will become more complicated later. This is the basic version.

- [ ] Done [link to proof](https://peprojects.dev) (one of the early challenges) (maybe we should make another slightly more edge-case filled challenge) (but also / most any semi-complex site should prove you've got this)

### How to write the HTML and CSS for a really beautiful article

We're talking beautiful for all readers. That means robot web crawlers, screen-readers and all the web reading technologies. Semantic HTML elements. An article (like this one here) - is essentially a data-structure, right? For the most part all of these elements are naturally responsive to the view-port. 

Which units do you use for what? Why?

Some companies like [Medium](https://medium.com/) or [SubStack](https://substack.com/) are 100% reliant on a great typography system. It may seem trivial - but it's not. People get paid hundreds of thousands of dollars a year - to just think about _this_.

Also a good time to use an HTML validator or run a lighthouse test.

This is a great time to do user testing. You can ask your friends and family. If the article is really enjoyable to read, then you can iterate. If it's not A+ then it's not done.

- [ ] Done [link to proof](https://peprojects.dev)

You can make many different article styles. And this will clearly extend to all future projects, right?


### A basic business-card style website

This can really be 1 page. It needs to say who you are, what you are doing, why we would care, and how to contact you. You can link to your newsletter. You can have more than one page. It should look "good" - leaving no reason to doubt your sense of taste.

You can have someone else help with fonts and spacing if that is hard. Simple and functional and publicly available.

Being able to pair down and really understand basic legibility and content - shows a lot more about you than programming will. It's hard. But it'll get easier if you try it.

We also suggest you get your [**/goals** and **/resume** pages](https://perpetual.education/exercises/goals-and-resume-pages/) going early.

- [ ] Done [link to proof](https://peprojects.dev)

This should be changing many many times throughout the course. But if you ever get lost - you can always come back to this state.

(Simple + done) > complex and broken or unfinished.

This also assumes that it's up on the web with FTP etc.

Again: you can test this with people. It should be a unanimous success or it's not successful.

**Things this could help prove:**

- Should respond to all view-port size and have solid type choices
- You know how to employ images / and ensure they are the right size
- You can use the dev tools to gauge performance on a basic level
- Validation / and basic accessibility
- if you are revisiting this 
	- then extra accessibility testing
	- dark mode / contrast checks


### Understanding metadata

You should be well acquainted with rich social sharing assets and why that is helpful for everyone.

What happens if there is no metadata? What are all of the options?

Even if you aren't planning on being a _graphic designer_ - you're still going to need to know how to crop images and prepare them for things like this. This also touches on _content strategy_ and SEO.

You could make a series of examples and test them. You could write a post about various options.

- [ ] Done [link to proof](https://peprojects.dev)

- if you are revisiting this later
	- you could look into structured data
	- site maps


### Basic graphic creation

We know that not everyone _wants_ to make graphics. But everyone should at least know how to use the shapes and combine them and subtract them and use a graphics program to copy a simple logo or amend a graphic you are given.

You should know how to use the tools enough to say "Yes. I've used the graphics programs and can open up files and work with them and export them." (even if you never end up doing that at work - it will help you get the job)

What can you do? Create your own logo. Create some graphics for your blog posts. Create some thumbnails for your projects. Or do one of the exercises like this [thing-a-day](https://perpetual.education/exercises/thing-a-day/)

Around this time is the website structure challenge

We could make a more advanced challenge for that ^.

### MILESTONE-01: https://peprojects.dev/milestones/early-html

Here are all of the things that students are expected to understand in depth at this point. They have the skills to look at the code - and everything should be clear. At this point there is a small set of elements and uses. So, if anything here isn't clear - then we should go over that in detail. And there probably needs to be a lot more practice.

---


### Practicing making websites

You'll have plenty of time to start trying copying websites.

You'll be getting more tools. Anchor links, CSS reset, some misc positioning techniques, more uses for inline-block elements and alignment, floats, box-sizing, more typography, CSS classes, inner-column ideas, and linked style-sheets to control many pages.

The 'research and destroy' project is a push to get you copying existing websites. This is something you can do to practice for the rest of the course/career. (you can make it fun)

- [ ] Research/Destroy example [link to proof](https://peprojects.dev)

- [ ] Hopefully you wanted to make more things... [link to proof](https://peprojects.dev)

- [ ] Some examples of research might be useful for case-studies

- [ ] There's _really_ no reason - why you couldn't do one of these every day...


[tending-your-garden](https://perpetual.education/resources/tending-your-garden/) (is this the right spot?)

---

This is all still before flexbox.

### MILESTONE-02: https://peprojects.dev/milestones/ (Derek is making these milestones ASAP)

Being able to create all these things - even without flexbox will prove that you really understand everything so far and especially display types and some alignment ideas.

We usually sneak @media rules and other tricks in based on the student. This stage should be challenging you enough to want to figure out why images and links and a bunch of stuff is breaking your layout.

---


### Responsive tricks checklist

There are a few key things you just have to know. Then everything going forward will be much easier.

You have to understand the box-model. For real. It's simple. If you can't explain it in full - then you haven't spent any time thinking trying. So, box model, box-sizing, why block elements can't be inside inline elements, how to fit it, how to make images behave, the display type options (_seriously_), clamp, media queries.

- [the-next-pieces](https://perpetual.education/lesson/layout-and-decisions/)

- [ ] Done [link to proof](https://peprojects.dev)

This is where you should probably have a bunch of experiments on your websites or in CodePen.


### Mock small business project

This project is supposed to throw you in the fire and give you only 4 days to complete.

research, plan content, write code, style it, iterate... 

And learn to _ask_ for feedback. That's key. Simple content is better than a big mess. But luckily - everyone always makes a big mess which gives us a lot to talk about.

- if you are revisiting this
	- you could flesh it out with all of your new skills
	- or pick any real or pretend business and do another one
	- These would be great portfolio pieces

- [ ] Done [link to proof](https://peprojects.dev)


### Start using version control

For now, you can use your own website and your pe-projects folder locally. You can start building up those green squares and pushing to gitHub. It'll keep things safe, and you could practice branching.

- [ ] Done (the proof will be on your github profile)


### Learn how to create/export SVGs to be used as code

At the very least, you should have a handle on this process. You can totally revisit the paired-down resources on this later. [svg-preperation](https://perpetual.education/resources/svg-preperation/)

But these can be really impressive to people. You should have at least 1 interactive SVG on your portfolio later on when we get to JavaScript. So, try and find something that is exciting to you and that can fit in with what type of company you want to work for.

- [ ] Done


### Responsive modules/components

We make that stripe example. That should get things moving. There are probably some layouts and things - that you've been wanting to make - but didn't have the layout tools yet. Now you do! So, you can! Try things. Practice things. Push things. Ask questions. Maybe there's something you want to make on your website?
 
- [ ] Done


### Super Responsive Challenge: Responsive layout (officially)

This is the main deal! Front-end developers make the part that people see. That means the data that crawlers see - and the look and feel of the layout. This is when we get serious about flexbox and responsive layouts.

You absolutely have to know how to build the common base page layout. That means a footer that sticks at the bottom of the page, probably a sticky header, columns etc.. Way too often people get further on in the course and they make sites with no reset, no CSS partials, not type-patterns, and it just seems like they didn't take this part seriously. So, if you couldn't knock one of these out in 5 minutes while we watch - then that's you!

Also: You should **want** to use positioning in interesting places. It's always one of the first things people ask about, but then when we get to it - everyone is a deer in headlights. If you don't try a whole bunch of ideas out and really understand how it works / then you might as well - just never learn it at all. Choose now. Do it now.

At this point, you should be able to recreate just about any website layout. [responsive-layout-checklist](https://perpetual.education/resources/responsive-layout-checklist/)

- [ ] Done [link to challenge 1](https://peprojects.dev)

- [ ] Done [link to challenge 2](https://peprojects.dev)


### Sandboxes and public learning

If you're having fun, you'll likely have lots of CodePens. But in general, you should be comfortable with _JSFiddle, CodePen, Glitch, Flems, Plunker or whatever_. You get how they work. You know that _sometimes_ it is better to create a small example in there - than building out a whole project locally. These are especially great for asking questions on StackOverflow and Discord etc.

If you don't have an account on StackOverflow and Discord - and you aren't answering questions on there for practice, you are missing out on a lot of learning and you aren't building any history for recruiter to see your activity. Being able to answer questions will do wonders for your confidence and will help solidify your knowledge.

- [ ] Done [link to proof](https://peprojects.dev)


### GitHub

Throughout this hole period - you'd also be learning how to make pull requests via group work on the alpha-net. This way - you can learn how to contribute to open source, learn those manners, how to deal with merge conflicts, and branches and all that Jazz. If you're doing well with that... then you might get to setup your GitHub with DeployBot to _deploy_ automatically.

- [ ] Done (proof would be in your GitHub user profile)

### CONSOLIDATION MEETING: 

This is when Ivy and Derek meet with the students. Roughly 1/3 of the way through in theory.

(Starting with alpha-4) We actually keep a Doc about each student now from the beginning.

## ⬤ Style

### Visual design intros

[Inspiration](https://perpetual.education/lesson/idea-boards/), 
[grayscale](https://perpetual.education/lesson/gray-scale/), 
[space](https://perpetual.education/lesson/space/), 
[contrast](https://perpetual.education/lesson/contrast/),
color ... 

These might be worth revisiting: 

This section was all intros and practice. So, it's not going to end up with finished projects. It'll just get things started.

Postcard exercise, secret word graphics, store style tile, symbols and icons, - there's a lot to work with there if you're interested in learning how to make graphics.

These aren't going to apply to everyone. But everyone can at the very _least_ come out of this with their first style tiles. And there's no reason they can't be good. And there's no reason why that style tile can't be actually built into a real website layout. (not one person has done that from the first 3 groups)

But then we start to get to some real deliverables.

- [ ] Done [link to proof](https://peprojects.dev)


### Personal website styles (with gusto!)

This can still be very simple... but it's about choosing a style. It's about establishing the amount of contrast needed to be a visual "design." It's about making choices that _work_.

There are a bunch of extra videos about this stuff. Derek has a bunch of speed runs that aren't even edited where he just designs sites and codes them up. It's about learning how to use a mindset/framework to be decisive.

In the linear path of the class, this would likely be your 3rd version of your website.

- [ ] Done [link to proof](https://peprojects.dev)

At this point - and for the rest of the course, the idea is to maintain a public website that will slowly change and allow you to have a long-lived project. This will be something you sculpt and maintain. If you're deleting it - or hiding it in a sub-folder, then you're doing it wrong.

This would also make a great early case-study example.

- [ ] Done [link to proof](https://peprojects.dev)

This also gives you an opportunity to style across many pages / and sub projects

### MILESTONE-03: https://peprojects.dev/milestones/ (Derek is making these milestones ASAP)

## ⬤ PHP

...


### The name of the thing

MAMP, partials/includes, control-flow, arrays/objects, loops, functions, 

This is the monster adoption week. So, there's a style-tile - and an opportunity to use all of the PHP stuff to create a dynamic page. There's a lot of opportunity to make that fun - and detailed... 

- [ ] Done [link to proof](https://peprojects.dev)

Or, you could also - make another site like that - or another theme. What are YOU interested in? This _should_ be an exciting milestone.


### Responsive layout garden

After you pulled off the responsive layout challenge, it's time to keep going. Now we have the modular PHP stuff - and so, - you can start collecting layouts.

[responsive-layout-collection](https://perpetual.education/exercises/responsive-layout-collection/)

- [ ] Done [link to proof](https://peprojects.dev)	


### Theme challenge

Pick a genre, industry: research, mood, style-tile, code,  

This is not creative. This is about emulating something. You are essentially copying something that already exists - but with a high level of precision.

This one is all about the details.

You can get the first 80% done pretty OK by now. But the _last 20%_ is the hardest. It's those details that really make something look "pro" or _official_ or whatever that is.

This will involve a lot of fine-tuning - and if you take it seriously: The goal is to make something look super serious pro. As if anyone who would look at it - wouldn't second guess it. It's either A+ or it's _not_.

- [ ] Done [link to proof](https://peprojects.dev)	

And - if you were on top of it, then - you'd have some extra time to make a second version, or - even make an example where you could toggle between themes. Examples: 

- [alpha-1](https://peprojects.dev/alpha-1/dmccall/ultra-responsive-styled-2x/) Major league sports / Makeup,
- [alpha-2](https://peprojects.dev/alpha-2/bdlowery/layout-paradise-v3/) Vacation family/couples, 
- [alpha-3](https://peprojects.dev/alpha-3/tara/projects/tareuhhhhhh-gaming/) Horror gaming

This is a **great** portfolio exercise. This is how brochure websites are designed and created. So, - this seems like a thing that most people should _want_ to practice.

If you really don't like doing the visual design parts, then - this is a perfect project for you to do - _many times_.
